# RTM For SCRUM
## About the project
SCRUM is a light-weight agile framework for software development. Requirement
Traceability Matrix (RTM) is a matrix which shows the linkage between two
requirements documents. For SCRUM, the developer can trace the relation between
Product Backlog and Sprint Backlogs using RTM. Retrieving requirements and
generating RTM manually is a complex and time-consuming process. This project
aimed to develop a web application that can generate an RTM based on any keyword and
can generate RTM within one minute. 

## Technologies
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.0.1.
The application was developed using Angular Framework, Angular Material, Typescript, PHP and MySQL.

## Results
The developed web application was
evaluated by comparing with the RTM generated manually method. The RTM that
generated by the developed web application always achieved higher accuracy than
the RTM generated manually. Besides, the developed web application spent less time
to generate RTM compared to manual generate method. The test result indicated that
using the application to generate RTM can improve the SCRUM teamâ€™s efficiency.
